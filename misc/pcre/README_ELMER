PCRE Elmer notice
=================

This directory structure does not contain the entire pcre library sources. Most
notably some of the autoconf build files and documentation has been removed in
order to minimize source code footprint of Elmer. 

For documentation of the PCRE library, one is adviced to see the full source
code package located under https://www.pcre.org.
